/*
  quadrature_adaptive_serial()

  Primary entry-point function for performing serial adaptive quadrature.

  This, effectively, just forwards input information to
  _quadrature_adaptive_serial(). The internal version of this function takes in
  several other input data which is determined by this function.

  This design pattern makes it such that the "user" doesn't need to know about
  the internals in order to make use of the code. That is, we hide the
  implementation details and try to make the forward-facing function
  quadrature_adaptive_serial() as easy to use as possible.
